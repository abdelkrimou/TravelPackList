# React Travel Pack List

This project is my second simple React application that helps users create and manage a travel pack list. It utilizes React's useState hook, props, components, and controlled elements for a seamless user experience.


## Features

- **Add Items:** Easily add items to your travel pack list.
- **Remove Items:** Remove items from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Check/Uncheck Items:** Mark items as packed or unpacked.
- **Dynamic Update:** The UI dynamically updates based on user actions.
